## Introduction 

Semantic search is a data information retrieval technique that focuses on improving search accuracy by understanding the intent and meaning of a given context. It has gathered immense interest and investment from technology firms seeking to improve user experience. One of the recent approaches to improve semantic search algorithms is using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) that emerged from applied topology and computational geometry in the last 20 years. By studying the shape of data and its properties, TDA seeks to provide a topological and geometric data analysis approach that is robust to the metric chosen and noise, and can be incorporated to many different data analysis and statistical learning areas. In the project, we focused on the use of TDA in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). First, we investigated the representational power of applying TDA in text analysis. Then, we designed a pre-trained and a fine-tuned semantic search engine based on Faiss and SEBRT - an emerging benchmark technology developed by Google for semantic search, as well as a novel topological asymmetric semantic search engine by combining TDA and SBERT. We then analyzed and compared their search performance, and demonstrated that TDA is a feasible technique that can be used in semantic search tasks.
